I've always been obsessed with making dumb things smart.

As a kid, I was fascinated by street lights that somehow "knew" when 
it got dark. That simple magic—technology solving a real problem 
without anyone thinking about it—stuck with me.

Fast forward to 2025, and most things are still frustratingly dumb. 
Your outside faucet will leak for weeks underground without notification. 
Your air conditioner breaks down silently until it stops removing heat. 
Your equipment fails predictably, but you only find out after it's too late.

There's incredible technology available today—IoT, cloud computing, AI, 
edge ML—but it's just tools. Tools don't solve problems by themselves. 
Someone has to actually build the applications, connect the sensors, 
write the code, and make it work in production.

That's where I operate: where the rubber meets the road.

I'm not interested in tech for tech's sake. I build practical systems 
that solve real problems and make life slightly better. Whether that's 
scaling a clean-tech startup to 10,000 devices, preventing industrial 
downtime with predictive maintenance, or automating manual operations 
with computer vision—I focus on tangible impact.
